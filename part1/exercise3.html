    <h1>Welcome to my First Exercise</h1>
    <p>For this exercise we will be creating a weigth metric converter</p>
    <p>We will take in a number in pounds (lbs) and convert it to killogram (kg). Right now we only know enough to to this one way, but later on we will learn how to add logic to this sort of problem!</p>
    <p>to complete this exercise to do the followings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link this HTML file (exercise3.html)to you own</li>
      <li>Use JavaScript to accept a number input in pounds(lbs) </li>
      <li>Then in your js file convert this number to killograms (*0.454) </li>
      <li>Afterwards report back in an alert what the weight is in kg</li>
      <li>then log write "Conversation Complete"</li>
